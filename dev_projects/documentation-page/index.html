                <p>Good indoor plants will tolerate lower light and humidity. Also, they will be less likely to deal with pests. Plus, they usually do not grow too much (you wouldn&#39;t want an indoor plant to grow at a rapid rate). The best indoor plants include the following:</p>
                
                <div>
                    <h2>Aglaonema</h2>
                    <p>Asia and Africa. The scientific name is derived from two Greek words; &quot;aglaos&quot;, meaning &quot;bright&quot; and &quot;nama&quot;, a filament or thread, referring to the striking stamens produced within the flowers. It is a popular plant with the Chinese, to whom it symbolizes long life and hence &quot;Chinese evergreen&quot;. The less romantic name of &quot;Painted droptongue&quot; refers to the leathery, more ovate or tongue-shaped leaves of Aglaonema crispum.</p>
                    <code>Avoid overwatering and cold<br>Evenly moist<br>Dark resistant</code>
                </div>
                
                <div>
                    <h2>Aspidistra</h2>
                    <p>The archetypal Victorian houseplant enjoying a resurgence in popularity due to its elegant and architectural shape. Almost indestructible. The Aspidistra Elatior is native to the Eastern Himalayas, Taiwan, China, and Japan commonly known as the &quot;cast-iron plant&quot; or &quot;iron plant&quot;. It is one of the few plants that we can say helped inspire or carry the lead in a novel. In 1936, George Orwell wrote his novel &quot;Keep the Aspidistra Flying&quot;.</p>
                    <code>Avoid overwatering and cold<br>Evenly moist<br>No direct sunlight</code>
                </div>
                
                <div>
                    <h2>Succulents</h2>
                    <p>In botany, succulent plants, also known as succulents, are plants that have some parts that are more than normally thickened and fleshy, usually to retain water in arid climates or soil conditions. The word "succulent" comes from the Latin word sucus, meaning juice, or sap.[1] Succulent plants may store water in various structures, such as leaves and stems. Some definitions also include roots, thus geophytes that survive unfavorable periods by dying back to underground storage organs may be regarded as succulents. In horticultural use, the term "succulent" is sometimes used in a way which excludes plants that botanists would regard as succulents, such as cacti. Succulents are often grown as ornamental plants because of their striking and unusual appearance.</p>
                    <code>Avoid overwatering<br>Need a lot of light</code>
                </div>
                
                <div>
                    <h2>Dracaena</h2>
                    <p>Dracaena plant care is fairly simple. Colorful strap-like foliage appears on many dracaena houseplant varieties. Many cultivars are large, tree-like plants while others are smaller. The houseplant dracaena exhibits an upright form no matter the cultivar.</p>
                    <code>Forgiving of temperatures<br>Keep soil moist<br>Keep in bright light</code>
                </div>
                
                <div>
                    <h2>Philodendrons</h2>
                    <p>Philodendron is a classic, and practically no-fail houseplant because it's so easy to grow. Happily, this makes it a pretty common indoor plant to find at your local garden center. The philodendron family is a pretty big one, too - so you can find a variety of plants that grow in a range of shapes, sizes, and colors. Many of the traditional philodendron varieties are vines perfect for growing on a totem, up a trellis, or in a hanging basket and some offer pleasing variegated foliage. These are counted as some of the most easy to grow houseplants of all time. Upright-growing philodendrons are just as easy, but typically have larger leaves.</p>
